# More about class

- Create a static method named `isEqual` which accepts two square instance (when you create a new object using the class). If the area of both square is same the method should return `true` or `false`. (Static methods are called directly on the class not in the instance)

- Create two instance of the `Square` class (ex: `let s1 = new Square(6);`)
